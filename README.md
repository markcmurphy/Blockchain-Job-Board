# Blockchain Jobs

Blockchain jobs is a jobboard allowing users to create, read, update, and delete employer profiles and jobs using Node.js, Express, and Mongo. 

## If I had more time:

* Enable permissions to prevent users from editing/deleting others' posted content
* Allow job-seekers to make profiles and save jobs
* Enable street address -> coordinates conversion 
* Enable Infoviews on Google Map to allow one to click on that particular job
